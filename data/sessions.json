I’m sorry for the regressions; I’ve been moving fast to hit deadlines and I realize I haven’t been thorough with testing, so I own that and want to fix it: I can immediately revert or hotfix the problematic merges, add failing tests for the broken behavior, and follow a stricter PR checklist plus require a second review/CI gate going forward — do you want me to start with the revert/hotfixes now or prioritize adding tests first?"
